Model that helps in predicting whether a tweet is positive,neutral or negative feedback.

The data has been collected from customers who tweet about how there experience was when they acquired the services of any airline on twitter.

The following are the dependencies you need to install before running the model

punkt,stopwords,state_union,averaged_perceptron_tagger,wordnet,maxent_treebank_pos_tagger
